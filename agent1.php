            <p class="agentInfoBold">Biography:</p>
            <p> I have loved travel for as long as I can remember. At the age of 12 I asked if I could fly by myself
                to Hawaii and I never came back. <br>
                <br>
                Right out of high school I started into travel school and have had the opportunity to work in many
                aspects of the industry. In every aspect I have worked I have had the opportunity to help people
                travel, to help fulfill people?s dreams, what could be beWer to do every day!</p>
